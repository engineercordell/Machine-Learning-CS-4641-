# Machine Learning 
A summation of all my machine learning class projects from fall 2024 ranging from topics that form the mathematical foundation of machine learining like linear algebra and probability theory to advanced supervised and unsupervised learning methods. 

In all project instances below, the compiled results are detailed in the respective folder's Jupyter Python file or in the PDF, but feel free to fully explore the depths of each project.

#### HW1: Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Optimization, Information Theory
#### HW2: KMeans, Expectation Maximization, Gaussian Mixture Model, Clustering Evaluation
#### HW3: Singular Value Decomposition, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Regression, Regularization, Naive Bayes
#### HW4: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks, CNN
